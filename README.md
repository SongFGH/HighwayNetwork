# HighwayNetwork

This project is my codes for Highway network using Keras with Theano backend.
More information about the model can be found in:

[Training very deep network](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5850-training-very-deep-networks)

There are two versions: Highway networks for vector data and Convolutional Highway networks for spatial data.
Highway networks for vector data is already implemented in Keras layers.
Convolutional Highway layer is written based on Keras Highway and Convolutional layers.
