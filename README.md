# HighwayNetwork

This project is my codes for Highway network using Keras with Theano backend.

There are two versions: Highway networks for vector data and Convolutional Highway networks for spatial data.
Highway networks for vector data is already implemented in Keras layers.
Convolutional Highway layer is written based on Keras Highway and Convolutional layers.
